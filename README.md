# 🚲 Bike Sales Dashboard | Excel Data Analysis Project

### 📌 Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset to identify the key demographics and buying behaviors of bicycle customers. The goal was to provide actionable insights to the marketing team to optimize future ad campaigns and improve sales conversion rates.

### ❓ Business Problem
**Stakeholder:** Sales Manager & Marketing Team.  
**Objective:** The sales team was struggling to identify which leads were most likely to convert into customers. They needed a data-driven approach to identify the "Ideal Customer Profile" and understand how variables like **Commute Distance**, **Age**, and **Income** influence purchase decisions.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
*   **Microsoft Excel**
    *   **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates, normalized text (e.g., changing "M" to "Married"), and handled missing values.
    *   **Data Processing:** Created custom columns (Age Groups) and utilized Nested IF statements.
    *   **Analysis:** Used Pivot Tables to aggregate data and identify trends.
    *   **Visualization:** Built an interactive Dashboard with Slicers for dynamic filtering.

### 🔍 Key Insights

Based on the analysis, we identified the following trends:

1.  **High-Value Customer Profile:**
    The ideal buyer is a **Middle-Aged (31-55)** individual earning approximately **$60,000 annually**. There is a direct correlation between higher income and purchase likelihood, suggesting pricing is a barrier for lower-income demographics.

2.  **The "0–1 Mile" Sweet Spot:**
    **Commute Distance** is the strongest predictor of a sale. The vast majority of purchases come from customers living within **0–1 miles** of their workplace. Sales volume drops significantly as travel distance increases.

3.  **Single vs. Married Behavior:**
    Using the dashboard slicers, a comparative analysis revealed a behavioral split:
    *   **Married** customers rarely buy if their commute exceeds **1 mile**.
    *   **Single** customers show a higher tolerance for commuting, with a resurgence in sales in the **2–5 mile** range.

### 💡 Strategic Recommendations

Based on the data, I recommend the following actions to the stakeholders:

*   **Geographic Targeting:** Focus ad spend heavily on dense urban zip codes where commutes are under 1 mile.
*   **Segmented Messaging:**
    *   **Targeting Singles:** Emphasize "Reliable Commuting" and "Fitness" for distances up to 5 miles.
    *   **Targeting Families:** Emphasize "Neighborhood Leisure" and short-distance convenience.
*   **Price Strategy:** Consider introducing financing plans for Single Male customers, as this demographic showed the highest income gap between buyers and non-buyers.
